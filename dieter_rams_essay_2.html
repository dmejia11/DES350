<h4>Principles for Good Design</h4>

<div id="one">1</div>
	<div class="p1"><div class="title">Good design is innovative:</div>
	<p>inventions are made everyday each day we progress more with new technology <br> and we make, new rules to our innovations, phones each year become better and smarter for the users and each company has a specific audience for what they target for.<br> As a graphic designer I would not apply this principle since I’m creating visuals and not physical inventions.</p></div>
	
<div id="two">2</div>
<div class="p2"><div class="title2">Good design makes a product useful:</div>
	<p>when making a good design its always important to think about the audience<br> you are targeting for and focus on those factors, city bikes is an example of a good design <br>targeting people who commute in the city.
I would apply this principle to my work because<br> as a graphic designer you want to make 
the visual design of showing <br> the audience the capability of the product.</p></div>
	
<div class="left">3</div>
<div class="p3"><div class="title3">Good design is aesthetic:</div>
	<p>time and effort are important when making a product and its best if we put our effort into products that we are going to see everyday. Music album covers are a principle <br>I use when discovering new music if the album cover gives an aesthetic, there’s a higher chance of me listing to the album.As a graphic designer its always important<br> to think about aesthetics when designing and making the composition appealing to the eye.
I would apply this principle sincentypography can be one of those elements</p></div>
<div class="right">4</div>
<div class="p4"><div class="title4">Good design makes a product understandable:</div><p>
when making a design, product its always best to think about simplicity and being straightforward. <br>Tools are products that have simplistic design and very easy to understand.<br> I would not apply this since I'm not designing products that are meant to be understood right away.</p></div>
<div class="left">5</div>
<div class="p3"><div class="title3">Good design is unobtrusive:</div><p>technology can be unobtrusive they are tools that we use everyday but aren’t a work of art. My laptop can follow this principle, but it's on the consumer if they personalize or not.<br> 
I would apply this principle based on types of visuals like creating typography <br>on street signs.</p></div>
<div class="right">6</div> 
<div class="p4"><div class="title4">Good design is honest:</div>
	<p>Its best to make the product to its full potential and tell the consumer the qualities of the product.<br>Advertisement can be more successful when showing the full potential of the ad<br> and telling the consumer straightaway what they are getting.<br> I would apply this principle when creating advertisements for an audience.</p></div>
<div class="left">7</div>
<div class="p3"><div class="title3">Good design is long-lasting:</div>
	<p>Seeing game consoles today is a principle and the simplicity of creating the design <br>on consoles. Xbox and Nintendo create a good lasting design.<br>I would apply this principle because it's important that visually I focus on lasting simplicity.</p></div>
<div class="right">8</div>
<div class="p4"><div class="title8">Good design is thorough down to the last detail:</div><p>it's always important to pay attention to detail and show detail in design to show the process of your work and thought.<br> Cameras show detail when made and used and that’s gives the user an automatic respect to cameras.<br>I would apply this principle because in any field its important to care about details.</p></div>
<div class="left">9</div>
<div class="p3"><div class="title3">Good design is environmentally friendly:</div><p>Each day designers come up with ways we can include this way of thinking when creating products that are friendly with the environment. environment posters always give <br> a reminder. I would apply this principle when creating and having in mind that visually <br>I can remind that design can help environmentally.</p></div>

<div class="ten">10</div>
<div class="p5"><div class="title5">Good design is as little design as possible:</div>
	<p>Having a hierarchy on your concept is always important and not having the user confused on what to focus on. Film posters are an example of eye catching having a busy poster can affect the users,<br> but having something simple and a strong focus point can go far when advertising the film.<br> I always apply this principle when design and a reminder that less bitter.</p></div>
