1. Good design is innovative: inventions are made everyday each day we progress more with new technology and we make, new rules to our innovations, phones each year become better and smarter for the users and each company has a specific audience for what they target for. As a graphic designer I would not apply this principle since I’m creating visuals and not physical inventions.
2. Good design makes a product useful: when making a good design its always important to think about the audience you are targeting for and focus on those factors, city bikes is an example of a good design targeting people who commute in the city. I would apply this principle to my work because as a graphic designer you want to make the visual design of showing the audience the capability of the product.
3. Good design is aesthetic: time and effort are important when making a product and its best if we put our effort into products that we are going to see everyday. music album covers are a principle I use when discovering new music if the album cover gives an aesthetic, there’s a higher chance of me listing to the album. As a graphic designer its always important to think about aesthetics when designing and making the composition appealing to the eye.
4. Good design makes a product understandable: when making a design, product its always best to think about simplicity and being straightforward. Tools are products that have simplistic design and very easy to understand. I would not apply this since I'm not designing products that are meant to be understood right away.
5. Good design is unobtrusive: technology can be unobtrusive they are tools that we use everyday but aren’t a work of art. My laptop can follow this principle, but it's on the consumer if they personalize or not. I would apply this principle based on types of visuals like creating typography on street signs. I would apply this principle since typography can be one of those elements.
6. Good design is honest: its best to make the product to its full potential and tell the consumer the qualities of the product. Advertisement can be more successful when showing the full potential of the ad and telling the consumer straightaway what they are getting. I would apply this principle when creating advertisements for an audience.
7. Good design is long-lasting: seeing game consoles today is a principle and the simplicity of creating the design on consoles. xbox and Nintendo create a good lasting design. I would apply this principle because it's important that visually I focus on lasting simplicity.
8. Good design is thorough down to the last detail: it's always important to pay attention to detail and show detail in design to show the process of your work and thought. Cameras show detail when made and used and that’s gives the user an automatic respect to cameras. I would apply this principle because in any field its important to care about details.
9. Good design is environmentally friendly: each day designers come up with ways we can include this way of thinking when creating products that are friendly with the environment. environment posters always give a reminder. I would apply this principle when creating and having in mind that visually I can remind that design can help environmentally.
10. Good design is as little design as possible: having a hierarchy on your concept is always important and not having the user confused on what to focus on. Film posters are an example of eye catching having a busy poster can affect the users, but having something simple and a strong focus point can go far when advertising the film. I always apply this principle when design and a reminder that less bitter.
